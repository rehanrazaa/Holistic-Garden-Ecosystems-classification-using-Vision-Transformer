The diversity of plant species in a garden ecosystem reflects complex ecological interactions, which are essential for
environmental balance. Traditional classification methods, primarily based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), often struggle to capture fine-grained features, limiting their effectiveness in biodiversity monitoring.
Considering these limitations, this study integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with K-means clustering for
comprehensive plant species classification. ViTs are employed for deep feature extraction, capturing complex spatial
dependencies across diverse ecological zones, while K-means clustering groups species into coherent clusters.
