# Overview
The diversity of plant species in a garden ecosystem reflects the complex ecological interactions that are essential for maintaining environmental balance. Traditional classification methods, primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often struggle to capture fine-grained features, limiting their effectiveness in biodiversity monitoring. Considering these limitations, this study integrates Vision Transformers (ViTs) with K-means clustering for comprehensive plant species classification. ViTs are employed for deep feature extraction, capturing complex spatial dependencies across diverse ecological zones, while K-means clustering groups species into coherent clusters.
